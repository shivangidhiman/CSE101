Introduction to Programming (CSE101)

Python Codes for:

1. **Transformation of 2D Geometric Shapes:** Interactive python program to apply transformations (both linear and non-linear) to an object and plot it using matplotlib.

2. **Betweenness Centrality**: Given a list of nodes sorted in decreasing order (according to their Standardized Betweenness Centralities), python code to report the first ‘k’ nodes with equal Standardized Betweenness Centrality. 

3. **K-Map Minimization**: Python code which takes a function of maximum 4 variables as input and gives the corresponding minimized function as the output (minimized using the K-Map methodology), considering the case of Don’t Care conditions.
